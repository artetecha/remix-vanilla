# Three-card blog layout using Remix and Vanilla Framework

## Goal

The exercise was to reproduce the three-card layout found (as I write) on the [home page of the Canonical Blog](https://canonical.com/blog) to present the "featured articles" section.

## Requirements

The only requirement for this exercise was to make us of Canonical's very own [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/).

## Tech used

This exercise is using: 

- [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/)

## How to run 

```

npm start
```

## Node version

This code has been tested with Node 18.x
