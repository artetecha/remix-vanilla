# Three-card blog layout using Remix and Vanilla Framework

## Goal

The exercise was to reproduce the three-card layout found (as I write) on the [home page of the Canonical Blog](https://canonical.com/blog) to present the "featured articles" section.

## Requirements

The main requirement for this exercise was to make use of Canonical's very own [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/).

## Tech used

This exercise is using: 

- [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/)

## How to run 

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Node version

This code has been tested with Node.js 18.x

## Browsers

This code has been verified to reproduce the layout correctly on the following browsers:

- Safari (16.3)
- Brave (v1.49.120)
- Firefox (111.0)
